description: >
  Module containing OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Access tokens are short-lived credentials used
  to authenticate API requests. Each token is associated with a client and optionally an account,
  and can have an associated refresh token for obtaining new access tokens.
aggregateProperties:
  - name: id
    type: id
    primaryKey: true
    nullable: false
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the access token. UUID v4 format, generated automatically on creation.
  - name: rowId
    type: bigint
    index: unique
    autoIncrement: true
    nullable: false
    description: >
      Auto-incrementing row identifier. Used for internal ordering and as a numeric alternative to UUID.
  - name: clientId
    type: id
    nullable: false
    relationship:
      type: many-to-one
      aggregateName: OAuthClient
      modulePath: o-auth/client
      key: id
      field: client
      avoidConstraint: true
    index: index
    description: >
      ID of the OAuth client that owns this access token. Links the token to the application
      and grant type used for authorization.
  - name: accountId
    type: id
    nullable: true
    description: >
      ID of the account (user) associated with this token. NULL for client_credentials grants
      that don't represent a specific user. Used to link tokens to user identity.
  - name: token
    type: text
    nullable: false
    description: >
      The access token string. JWT or opaque token value. SECURITY: Transmitted in Authorization
      headers for API authentication. Should be short-lived to minimize security risk.
  - name: name
    type: varchar
    maxLength: 128
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Optional descriptive name for the access token. Useful for personal access tokens or
      long-lived tokens to identify their purpose (e.g., "Mobile App", "CI/CD Pipeline").
  - name: isRevoked
    type: boolean
    nullable: false
    defaultValue: false
    example: false
    description: >
      Indicates whether the access token has been revoked. Revoked tokens are rejected for
      API authentication. Set to true on logout, security events, or manual revocation.
  - name: expiresAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Expiration timestamp for the access token. After this time, the token is invalid for
      API requests. Typically set to minutes or hours from creation for security.
  - name: refreshToken
    type: relationship
    nullable: true
    description: >
      One-to-one relationship with a refresh token. When present, the refresh token can be
      used to obtain a new access token after this one expires.
    relationship:
      type: one-to-one
      aggregateName: OAuthRefreshToken
      modulePath: o-auth/refresh-token
      avoidConstraint: true
  - name: createdAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Timestamp when the access token was created. Automatically set on creation.
  - name: updatedAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Timestamp when the access token was last updated. Automatically updated on modification.
  - name: deletedAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Soft delete timestamp. NULL means active token. When set, token is excluded from normal
      queries but preserved for audit trail.
