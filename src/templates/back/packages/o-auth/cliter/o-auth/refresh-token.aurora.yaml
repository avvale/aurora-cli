description: >
  Module containing OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens. Refresh tokens are long-lived credentials used
  to obtain new access tokens without requiring user re-authentication. Each refresh token
  is associated with a single access token and can be revoked for security purposes.
aggregateProperties:
  - name: id
    type: id
    primaryKey: true
    nullable: false
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the refresh token. UUID v4 format, generated automatically on creation.
  - name: rowId
    type: bigint
    index: unique
    autoIncrement: true
    nullable: false
    description: >
      Auto-incrementing row identifier. Used for internal ordering and as a numeric alternative to UUID.
  - name: accessTokenId
    type: id
    nullable: false
    relationship:
      type: one-to-one
      aggregateName: OAuthAccessToken
      modulePath: o-auth/access-token
      field: accessToken
      avoidConstraint: true
    index: index
    description: >
      ID of the associated access token. One-to-one relationship ensures each refresh token
      is tied to a specific access token instance.
  - name: token
    type: text
    nullable: false
    description: >
      The refresh token string. JWT or opaque token value. SECURITY: Must be stored securely
      and treated as a sensitive credential. Used to request new access tokens.
  - name: isRevoked
    type: boolean
    nullable: false
    defaultValue: false
    example: true
    description: >
      Indicates whether the refresh token has been revoked. Revoked tokens cannot be used to
      obtain new access tokens. Set to true on logout or security events.
  - name: expiresAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Expiration timestamp for the refresh token. After this time, the token cannot be used
      to obtain new access tokens. NULL means no expiration (not recommended for security).
  - name: createdAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Timestamp when the refresh token was created. Automatically set on creation.
  - name: updatedAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Timestamp when the refresh token was last updated. Automatically updated on modification.
  - name: deletedAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Soft delete timestamp. NULL means active token. When set, token is excluded from normal
      queries but preserved for audit trail.
