description: |
  Core module that defines the bounded contexts of the application. A bounded context represents a logical boundary within the domain, grouping related modules and their permissions. Used by the IAM system to organize and manage access control across different functional areas of the application.
aggregateProperties:
  - name: id
    description: |
      Unique identifier for the bounded context. UUID v4 format, generated automatically on creation. Used as primary key and for references.
    type: id
    primaryKey: true
    nullable: false
  - name: rowId
    description: |
      Auto-incremented sequential identifier for internal database indexing. Used for ordered retrieval and performance optimization. Unique across all bounded contexts.
    type: bigint
    index: unique
    autoIncrement: true
    nullable: false
  - name: name
    description: |
      Human-readable name of the bounded context. Used for display purposes in UI and documentation. Should be unique and descriptive of the domain area it represents (e.g., 'Identity and Access Management', 'Library Management').
    type: varchar
    maxLength: 128
    nullable: false
  - name: root
    description: |
      Root directory path where the bounded context code is located. Typically matches the module structure (e.g., 'iam', 'library', 'catalog'). Used by code generation tools and for file organization. Must match actual filesystem structure.
    type: varchar
    maxLength: 64
    nullable: false
  - name: sort
    description: |
      Display order for UI lists and navigation menus. Lower numbers appear first. NULL values are sorted last. Allows manual organization of bounded contexts in administrative interfaces.
    type: smallint
    unsigned: true
    nullable: true
  - name: isActive
    description: |
      Indicates if the bounded context is currently active and available. Inactive bounded contexts are hidden from UI and their permissions are not enforced. Use for temporary disabling without deletion.
    type: boolean
    nullable: false
    defaultValue: false
    example: true
  - name: permissions
    description: |
      Collection of permissions associated with this bounded context. Each permission defines access to specific operations within the bounded context's modules. Managed through the grid elements manager component.
    type: relationship
    nullable: true
    relationship:
      type: one-to-many
      singularName: permission
      aggregateName: IamPermission
      modulePath: iam/permission
      avoidConstraint: true
    webComponent:
      type: grid-elements-manager
  - name: createdAt
    description: |
      Timestamp when the bounded context was created. Automatically set on record creation. Used for audit trail and historical tracking.
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
  - name: updatedAt
    description: |
      Timestamp when the bounded context was last updated. Automatically updated on any modification. Used for audit trail and change tracking.
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
  - name: deletedAt
    description: |
      Soft delete timestamp. NULL indicates active record. When set, the bounded context is excluded from normal queries but preserved for audit and recovery purposes. Cascade affects associated permissions.
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
excludedOperations:
  - count
  - getRaw
  - max
  - min
  - rawSql
  - sum
  - updateAndIncrement
  - upsert
