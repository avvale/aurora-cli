description: >
  Module for storing application-wide key-value configuration pairs. Supports
  multiple data types (string, number, boolean, date, object, array, secret)
  with optional caching and activation control. Used as a flexible configuration
  store across all bounded contexts.
aggregateProperties:
  - name: id
    type: id
    primaryKey: true
    nullable: false
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the key-value record. UUID v4 format, generated
      automatically on creation.
  - name: rowId
    type: bigint
    index: unique
    autoIncrement: true
    nullable: false
    description: >
      Auto-incrementing numeric identifier. Used for efficient sorting and
      internal ordering. Unique across all records.
  - name: key
    type: varchar
    maxLength: 64
    nullable: false
    index: unique
    description: >
      Unique identifier key for the configuration value. Maximum 64 characters.
      Must be unique across all records. Recommended to use dot notation for
      namespacing (e.g., 'app.feature.enabled', 'email.smtp.host').
  - name: type
    type: enum
    enumOptions:
      - ARRAY
      - BOOLEAN
      - DATE

    nullable: false
    description: >
      Data type of the stored value. Determines parsing and validation rules.
      ARRAY: JSON array. BOOLEAN: true/false. DATE: Date without time. NUMBER:
      Numeric value. OBJECT: JSON object. SECRET: Encrypted sensitive data.
      STRING: Text value. TIME: Time without date. TIMESTAMP: Date and time.
  - name: value
    type: text
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Serialized value content. Stored as text regardless of type; parsed based
      on the type field. NULL indicates no value set. For OBJECT and ARRAY
      types, stores JSON string. For SECRET type, stores encrypted data.
  - name: isCached
    type: boolean
    nullable: false
    defaultValue: false
    description: >
      Indicates if this value should be cached in memory for faster access.
      Default: false. Set to true for frequently accessed configuration values
      to improve application performance.
  - name: isActive
    type: boolean
    nullable: false
    defaultValue: true
    description: >
      Activation status of the configuration. Default: true. Inactive
      configurations (false) are ignored by the application but preserved for
      audit or potential reactivation.
  - name: description
    type: text
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Human-readable explanation of the configuration's purpose and usage.
      Optional but recommended for documentation. Helps developers understand
      the configuration's role and expected values.
  - name: createdAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Timestamp when the record was created. Automatically set by the system.
      Part of the audit trail.
  - name: updatedAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Timestamp of the last update. Automatically updated by the system on each
      modification. Part of the audit trail.
  - name: deletedAt
    type: timestamp
    nullable: true
    description: >
      Soft delete timestamp. NULL indicates active record. When set, record is
      excluded from normal queries but preserved for audit trail and potential
      recovery.
